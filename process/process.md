# Process
What does our development/project process look like?

## Scrum
We're using a form of Scrum as our process framework. This involves having a PO that is responsible for writing and prioritizing user stories and having a Scrum Master that is responsible for moderating, preparing and documenting meetings.
These meetings consist of: "Daily" Standup, Planning, Review and Retrospective. Our Sprint length is 2 weeks.

### Daily Standup
During the daily standup everyone shortly lies out what he or she has done since the last daily. These mandatorily happen twice a week with the full team and on all other days with everyone that is currently there.

### Planning
During the planning Meeting the Team decides what stories to complete in the next 2 weeks and splits those into Tasks that are being distributed to all team members. How exactly this process happens is the responsibility of the current scrum master.

### Review
During the Review Meeting the Team presents what it has done in the last 2 weeks. What stories have been finished? What is the state of the product? How has the velocity been? Are we on track in the grand scheme of things?

### Retrospective
The Retrospective is a meta meeting about the process. During this meeting the team will figure out what is going well and what isn't going so well and most importantly what can be done about it. To support finding those points of friction the Scrum master decided on a retro technique before the meeting and moderates it.
