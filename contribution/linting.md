# Linting
For Linting we're using pylint with default pep8 style for python:
https://www.pylint.org/


And ESLint with the Airbnb Preset for our javascript code: https://eslint.org/

Code cannot be merged without these linters passing. This leads to a unified code style which makes it more readible for everyone involved. It also hopefully helps keeping code quality to decent standards.
