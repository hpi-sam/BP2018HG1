### Big Takeaways:
* Jascha is assigned as **Scrum Master** for now. This might change in a few months. He is responsible to keep track of the process and keeping everyone on track.
* Arne is assigned as **Product Owner** and therefore responsible for communication with Chris, D-School and any other Stakeholders.In addition to that he will formulate User Stories that will be used during the Planning Meeting. Erik is assigned as **Co-PO**, he is not directly responsible but will help with writing stories, proofread them and also help in communication.
* No more user story writing as the whole team.
* This changes the process to be more in line with basic Scrum.

### The Team will:
* Take care of the room: everyone takes care of their office space when they leave, last one closes windows!
* Take Standups more seriously at Monday 9:15 and Thursday 9:15
* Work more in Team/Pairs. Value pairprogramming and try to do it as much as possible.
* Take Reviews more seriously.
* Document APIs as early as possible in the respective repositories
* Swap repositories each sprint

* Add all meetings to the calendar (Jascha)
* Send Luise an Image of yourself so that she can print a circle of it that is used on our hardware Kanban board to indicate who is assigned to which task. Also set these as your github profile picture please :) (Everyone)
