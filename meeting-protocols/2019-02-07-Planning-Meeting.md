# Protocol

Slightly different agenda then usually (more defensive planning) since most Userstories weren't  
finished last sprint and we will still be having exams during the next sprint:

1. Everyone gives a rough estimate on how much time they still need (5min)

    - Leo: #29 #38 #42
    - Erik: #21
    - Jascha: #48 #25
    - Luise: #41 #14
    - Adrian: #31 #25
    - Arne: #43 #48 #22 #23 #24
  
2. Assign backup userstories if needed (5min)
    - Erik: help Jascha
