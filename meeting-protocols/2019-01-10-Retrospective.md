# Protocol

1. Points from last meeting:
* Elija is still not completely understood. Adrian will figure out a way to share his knowledge (Presentation?)
* Don't let Arne do everything with Dialogflow -> Leo will help
* SEND LUISE YOUR PICTURES!
* Keep tally of everyones Mate consumption (Luise will print it)
* Architecture and API overhead -> No more Esra, do everything in Elija
* Problems with Task stealing -> Jascha and Leo will communicate better
* Grades mess with the process -> will be discussed with Christian (Jascha/Arne)
* Standups not being attended by everyone -> Moved to 13.30 EVERY DAY. Mondays and Thursdays with everyone attending, on other days optional.
* Meeting overhead/Long meetings -> Work on discussion culture, move topics to later dates, time keeping, only one person talks.
