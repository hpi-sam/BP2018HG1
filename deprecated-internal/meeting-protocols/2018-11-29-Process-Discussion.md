# Protocol Process Discussion 29.11.2018

### Goal of this Meeting:
- Define a process between supervisors, the team and D-School.

### Open Questions:
1. Who defines what Features have priority?
- The Team does, with consideration of D-School requirements
2. Is an internal PO okay? / What exactly is Chris role in project management?
- If everything runs smoothly, Chris is only Mentor. An internal PO is the Teams decision and completely fine.
3. What actually are Chris' requirements?
- See guidelines below, since the D-School research project didn't get accepted he has basically no functional requirements.
4. How do they overlap with the wishes of D-School?
- See above!
5. Which has priority?
- Don't code for the D-School otherwise we will be stuck with usability problems for the whole project. Do something cool, inovative, new while still being useful for D-School. The ideas for this have to come from the Team itself though. In Scrum terms: The teams is empowered to be their own customer!

### Reoccurring Problems:
1. Feedback from customer POV vs Feedback from supervisor POV.
- Since neither Chris is a Customer the Feedback is always from a supervisor/coaches perspective!
2. Our implementation and understanding of Agile/SCRUM.
- Is fine for everyone currently! 
3. Grading messes with process.
- No more grades in review for people individually. Accountabilities persist!

## Actual Agenda Points
1. Introduction/What let to this meeting? (see above!)
2. Validation of Discussion from earlier today.
3. Explanation of our current process Scrum implementation.
4. Open Discussion: Check if all the above questions are answered!
