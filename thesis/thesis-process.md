# Bachelor Thesis Process

### Mid March: Idea
- have an idea for your bachelor thesis ready
- have it approved/blessed by the Christians
- main got-to person for that is Chris
  - Christian only via email (1.3.-18.3.) and Prof. Giese if you can get hold of him
- take the initiative

### Mid March: Workshop on Scientific writing
- probably also mid march, see Desicna

### Inbetween: Write Expos√©
- take some time off project work to practice scientific writing, supported by teaching team
- objective agreement for bachelor thesis
- can be reused for thesis
- will be read by Prof. Giese for approval
- deadline will be in calendar

### End of March: Hand in Thesis (Topic)

### Requirements for Thesis
- may be in english or german
- has to be a research question that can be explored systematically
  - typical topic: compare 2 libraries in regard to a problem
  - bad topic: how you used technique x in your project (hard to explore systematically)

### Things to consider
- LaTex Master, LaTeX Template, saves a lot of work
